NEW YORK, Sept. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Incorporating new and advanced products into the existing work environment in order to simplify a particular job, is becoming an important tool for enhancing business process efficiency. 

3D/4D technology products are one such kind that provides such flexibility, even in the most complex work environments. The use of this technology helps in generating important accurate information before the final production in order to avoid flawed outcome, thus, reducing production cost and time. 

The Global 3D/4D Technology Market is projected to witness CAGR of 22.54% over the forecast period. North America, being a mature market holds the highest market share followed by Europe and Asia Pacific, which is witnessing highest growth on account of wide acceptance of 3D/4D technologies in gaming and entertainment. 

The 3D/4D technology, which was once, used majorly for entertainment, is now increasingly being used across other industries such as healthcare, education and construction driving the market. Along with it, producing or manufacturing individualized parts and components, to cater to small-scale industry needs, is contributing largely to the growth of the current 3D/4D technology market. 

The factors restraining this market are; high costs associated with the products that have the capability of producing the output by using 3D/4D technology. Also, the use of this technology in various sectors hasn't been perfected yet and still requires certain improvements to make it fully functional without any technological flaws. One other minor drawback of 3D/4D technology is the software related glitches that most of the technologies possess. The opportunity for the 3D/4D technology market is creating a lot of buzz across the world for its multiple usage on a single platform. Some of the 3D technology integrated products that already in the market are 3D Sensors, 3D Integrated Circuits, 3D Transistors, 3D Printer, 3D Gaming, 3D Imaging and others. 

The 3D/4D technology is being used across different industry verticals like Entertainment and Media, Healthcare, Education, Government and others. Some of the major vendors in this market are 3D Systems Corporation, Dolby Laboratories, Inc., LG Electronics Inc., Barco N.V., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and others.
