Quantitative Systems Pharmacology approaches continue to gain momentum in pharmaceutical and biotech companies due to their potential to save companies significant costs and shorten research timelines. Applied BioMath's Founders and Top Scientists have been key contributors in industry to such QSP successes for over a decade, and now with its proprietary technology, Applied BioMath brings its experience and unique modeling approach to its collaborators. With a computational platform built specifically for biological systems and high"er"-throughput computing than existing tools, Applied BioMath is delivering prediction approaches, which when validated in the clinic, were proven to be 10x more accurate than accepted industry standards. Dr. Burke's talk will highlight one successful use of QSP in immuno-oncology. 

"I am excited to present the value of how QSP approaches can help our partners make better decisions by quantifying risk and testing hypotheses in silico, early and often. Key here is highlighting how critical this iterative approach can be."
