Before he was convicted of murder in 2000, Padmanabha, a resident of Guttigar village in Dakshina Kannada district’s Suliya taluk, had only an SSLC pass as an educational qualification. But, when he walked out of Mysuru Central Jail on Thursday, Padmanaba had not only passed his B.A. and M.A., but was also armed with a diploma in journalism. 

Mr. Padmanabha was one of the 53 lifers, who were released prematurely from Mysuru Central jail on Thursday. 

Retired Professor of University of Mysuru Nanjaraj Urs, whose Antha Karana Trust helped establish a Karnataka State Open University (KSOU) Study Centre for graduation and postgraduation on the Mysuru jail premises, said Padmanabha is keen to become a teacher. 

Close to 250 prisoners had obtained degrees ever since the trust opened the study centre in 2010, said even reformed naxals had joined mainstream society after arming themselves with degrees during their stay in Mysuru jail. 

Though the government pays for the tuition of convicts, there is no such provision for undertrials, many of whom spend up to seven and eight years in jail. “Antha Karana bears the educational expenditure of such students,” he said. Prof. Urs felicitated Mr. Padmanabha at the farewell organised for the freed convicts in Mysuru Central jail on Thursday
